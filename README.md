# **Generative AI Art Project**

Welcome to the Generative AI Art Project! In this project, I utilized a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model to generate and modify paintings in the style of the renowned artist Edvard Munch. This repository demonstrates the power of generative AI in art creation.

## **Introduction**

Generative AI has opened up exciting possibilities in the realm of art. In this project, I've harnessed the capabilities of a VAE to create and modify paintings inspired by Edvard Munch. Edvard Munch is famous for his emotionally charged works, and I aimed to capture the essence of his style in our generated images.
Dataset

To train the VAE model, I used a dataset containing a collection of 1769 paintings by Edvard Munch. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, a popular platform for data science and machine learning datasets.
Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project were:

    Generation: To create new paintings in the style of Edvard Munch, capturing his unique artistic characteristics.

    Modification: To modify existing paintings, offering a new perspective and artistic reinterpretation.

## **Getting Started**

If you're interested in experimenting with this project or exploring the generated artwork, you can get started by following these steps:

    Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

    Download dataset on Kaggle : [(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/isaienkov/edvard-munch-paintings)]

    Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies and libraries installed. You can find the requirements in the project's requirements.txt file.

    Training the Model: If you wish to retrain the VAE model, follow the instructions in the project's documentation.

## **Usage**

Once the model is trained, you can use it to generate and modify images. Instructions and code examples can be found in the project's documentation.

## **Results**

The 'Results' section provides a gallery of generated and modified artworks, showcasing the creative potential of the VAE model in the style of Edvard Munch. Feel free to explore and be inspired by these AI-generated masterpieces.
